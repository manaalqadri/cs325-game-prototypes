<div id="readme">
    <h3>Originality</h3>
    <li>This uses the "First Game" example. I used the base code to get the coins to disable when overlapped with the ship, After that, the concept in making the ship jump with the water was my own. I played around with the physics and overlaying images so that the wave was hidden under the ship. Unfortunately, the wave can collect the coins along with the ship. That was not what I was tring to do but became a byproduct of the implementation.</li>

    <h3>Technical Merit</h3>
    <li>Camera follows the player, there's a parallax on the background, the coins float and are auto generated, and the player can only move in one direction</li>

    <h3>Prototype Postmortem:</h3>
    I learned how to get the camera to follow the sprite as well as make prallax backgrounds so the game looked like it had more depth.
    The parallaz was the easiest part of the game. It was one function connected to the images. The hardest was getting the coins to disappear and collect the score
    </li>

    <h3>Prototype Assets:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Amalgamation of the different Phaser Examples until it all works together</li>
    <li>Art is all unique (made by myself)</li>
    <li>Code based on "First Game" from Phaser</li>
    </ul>
