<h2>Find the shaker</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Source(s): https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/scenes/registry%20data%20exchange%20es6.js&v=3.52.0 and template
This was a merge between the template example (click to shake) and the box example that is linked. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This is mouse based game. I used an interactive sprite to recognize events based on mouse clicks
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learned how to get the mouse to recognize clicks
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Assets are 100% from scratch. I altered an image I used fro DA0 and pixelated it.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
A mix of the sources
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Click the sprites to find the one that shakes.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse - A lot of Randomness - Collector - Puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Tests event handling with the mouse
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Interest while looking for one specific sprite hidden amongst many
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The actions the player can preform is clicking a mouse on a sprite. THe player will see their score go down for every wrong click made.
The point of the game is to see how quickly the player can find the hidden sprite. Once the sprite is found, refresh to play again.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Luck is arguably the only element needed in terms of strategy
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Abstract, this is more of a simple arcade game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who want to procrastinate a little
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
two minutes.
</li>

</ul>
