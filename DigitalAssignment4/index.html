<h2>Find the Shaker i2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Reitrating DA2: The first iteration, I had just the game without a preoloader or main menu, and when the score was collected, it went to the negative. It also had the "shaker" as exclusively one of the blue moons.
This time around, I implemented a preloader and main menu. I also switched the scoring to go in the positive and not count the shaker when found. I guess tjhe title is a bit misleading, with the purpose now being 
"AVOID the shaker" than "find the shaker". I adjusted the randomness of the moonchild to be within the borders, else they would have generated above the border and scoring. I also moved the button to be in
the center so that it replaces the preloader. There is now a popup to indicate a game over, there is also one to show the winning (when all but the shaker is clicked). And the shaker can now be either blue or yellow.
I also took out the music.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I use a lot of randomness in the game. choosing the shaker for example, as well as generating the moonchildren. There was a lot of trial and error in finding the sweet spot of generating the sprites. I was also trying
to implement a change of characters but thta proved to be way above what I could do. I needed a little more time for research on. I might get it in a few more days. using if statements has, for some reason, been a bit challenging.
I think I need to research more on keys to make it work.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I got closer to what I wanted this game to be intially. getting the popup to show up was a bit difficult, I got the game over sign to show up but the game won sign isn't showing up like I thought it would. I also wanted the popups to
lead back to teh main menu, but the click handler isn't recognizing it. I need to look more into interactivity with objects.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Loading screen: self-made</li>
<li>Button: Phaser example <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/buttons/action-on-click">Action On Click</a></li>
<li>Sprites: Selfmade</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li> I used the minimal-class template and DA2</li>>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Find all the moon childeren without clicking on the shaker.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Iteration of DA2
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Exploring the extent of randomness
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game is nothing but luck. So there is a bit of a gambling feel without putting anything down.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

</ul>
