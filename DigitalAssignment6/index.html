<div id="readme">
    <h3>Originality</h3>
    <li>This game isn't original in the concept, it's a point and click game where you look for clickable items and it plays
        like a hidden objects game. I intended to place more originality through the game set up; I was hoping to get more rooms,
        more objects, and more story involved. I should be able to do that with the next iteration as I now have a better understanding
        on how to implement the game. 
    </li>

    <h3>Technical Merit</h3>
    <li>Buttons and functions. The entire game is a group of buttons working with each other. I think the way I implemented the
        buttons is a bit tedious, I made a function for each one, one to open the clue and then another function to close.
        It wasn't until later that I realized that I could probably merge them into one function and pass through the game object.
        I will be working towards making it more intuitive, code-wise. 
        To hide the objects, since I didn't want to destroy them, I moved to the side of the screen. So they still exist, but hidden.
        This is extremely inefficient but I couldn't find a better way to do it. So, currently, clicking an item just creates a new instance
        and I'm sure at some point, it would make the game overbearing as the images are just getting thrown to a pile.
    </li>

    <h3>Prototype Postmortem:</h3>
    <li>
        I learned the usage of buttons using .json files. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I was apprehensive in using
        the type because I was afraid of editing the file templates. Everything turned out well, I also figured out that I wouldn't have to
        make a file for each button. I made a "group" that used the same format and just made sure every button I create thereafter matched
        the file criteria. It worked well for the most part, but for bigger sized items I'll have to make a new template. 
    </li>

    <h3>Prototype Assets:</h3>
    <li><ul>
    <li>90% of the art is all unique (made by myself)</li>
    <li>Images that clues lead to:

    <h3>Prototype Closest Other Game:</h3>
    <li>N/A - I made the game based on Flash based games I played when I was younger, I don't have links to those though.</li>

    <h3>High Concept:</h3>
    <li>Find where Dr. Viator disappeared to using the clues around the room.</li>

    <h3>Theme:</h3>
    <li>N/A</li>

    <h3>Mandated Variety:</h3>
    <li>Input: Clickable Buttons</li>
    <li>Randomness: Deterministic</li>
    <li>Play Styles: Explorer, Storyteller</li>
    <li>Genres: Point and Click, Hidden Object</li>

    <h3>Prototype Goal:</h3>
    <li>Have clues that show something and have it hide when closed. I think my prototype did this, just not as well as it could have</li>

    <h3>Player Experience Goals:</h3>
    <li>Learning about new places. I've always been interested in using games as educational tools. I think the range we currently have for educational purposes
        feels a little gimmicky and so don't get played with fervor. I want to create games that are fun to play, nice to look at, and are engaging so that people keep coming
        back to play and learn a little more, or come back to play because it was fun.
    </li>

    <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
    <li>The player clicks the buttons around the room and tries to figure out the city/country based onn the clues shown (in a finished game, there would be a box to input
        guesses). The player can use the internet to their heart's content to search how the clues all relate to each other and in the process learn more about different countries
        or different cities. For this prototype, for example, the lilies on the table reference Italy's national flower.  
    </li>

    <h3>Strategies:</h3>
    <li>Items will "light up" when hovered over to show it's clickable. Moving the mouse around the screen helps in finding clues.
    </li>

    <h3>Story/Setting/Premise:</h3>
      <li>Dr. Viator, the famous historian, has suddenly disappeared. No one knows where she could be! The media is speculating that she's been kidnapped. There are some that say she's messed with 
          something big and put her nose in business she wasn't meant to know (she does that a lot). The police think she could have been murdered. 
          As her new assistant, you are the first suspect. She mentioned taking a vacation soon, she probably forgot to tell you when that would be.
          Find Dr. Viator to clear your name. Where could she be? 
    </li>

    <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
    <li>Anyone curious about different places</li>

    <h3>Play Time:</h3>
        <li>Ideally more than 10minutes, but this particular game would take at most 5 minutes.</li>
