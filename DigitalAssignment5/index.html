<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? I learned how to create and manipulate sprites and their animations
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? The easiest part was creating the art, the hardest was trying to get the system to recognixe the sprite sizes. The template had them bigger, and I wanted them to be a bit smaller.
